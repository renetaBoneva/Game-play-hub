## Description
Game Play Hub is a personal project, made with ReactJS. I decided to challenge myself to create a website for various games. Building a full stack project helped me to develop new abilities and to wrap my knowledge from Software University (SoftUni).

### Project design
I designed the website and created the logo entirely by myself, using only HTML and CSS. 

## Overview

### State management
I decided to use Redux to handle the current user information because it's more secure. For better user experience, I chose to save the user's access token in local storage. This way, gamers don't need to log in to their profiles every time they visit the website.

## Back-End
 I made a custom server for Game Play Hub. You can check the repository here:  
 https://github.com/renetaBoneva/Game-play-hub-Server

 ## Getting started
* Clone the repo from github.
* Open integrated terminal on game-play-hub directory and run `npm install`.
* Run `npm start` to start the project. 
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

*NOTE:* This will work with deployed server.
